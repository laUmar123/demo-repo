# Learning to use Git

This is practice, I'm going to learn the key concepts of git and practice using git with this repository being the main practice place for testing.

## sub-heading
I am writing this from VS code, this is the first line i've written so far.

## what i've done so far
1.) I've learnt the basics of git, such as cloning, git status, git add, git push, etc
2.) Now i'm learning about branching, I'm currently in another branch not my main one.
